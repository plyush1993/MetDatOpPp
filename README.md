# MetDatOpPp
Metabolomics Datasets for Optimization of Pre-Processing from [*Metabolomics Workbench*](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/) and [*MetaboLights*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/index) repositories.
All missing values were coded as gaps. Non-informative columns and samples were preliminarily deleted. The table contains key information about datasets: file name, source link, label for LC/MS run order, number of batches, total number of factors and two columns with structure of factors.

File Name | Source | Run Order | Batch | Total Factors | Numeric Factors | Categorical Factors
